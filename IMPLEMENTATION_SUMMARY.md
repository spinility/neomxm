# Cortex Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a **Cortex Expert System** for Sketch-NeoMXM that intelligently routes user requests to the most appropriate AI model based on task complexity, optimizing for cost, speed, and quality.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Architecture

**Files Created:**
- `cortex/cortex.go` - Main orchestrator
- `cortex/expert.go` - Expert evaluation and execution logic
- `cortex/config.go` - Configuration management
- `cortex/performance.go` - Performance tracking and logging
- `cortex/cortex_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite

### 2. Expert Profiles (YAML-based)

**Three-tier hierarchy:**
1. **FirstAttendant** (gpt-5-nano)
   - Fast, cost-effective
   - Handles simple, predictable tasks
   - Confidence threshold: 0.75

2. **SecondThought** (DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp)
   - Mid-tier orchestrator
   - Decomposes complex problems
   - Elite complexity threshold: 0.85

3. **Elite** (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
   - Premium solver
   - Handles most challenging tasks
   - Always executes (no escalation)

### 3. Meta-Expert Profiles (For Future Use)

Created but not yet integrated:
- **PerformanceAnalyzer** - Identifies optimization opportunities
- **ExpertRecruiter** - Suggests new specialized experts (EV+)
- **MemorySummarizer** - Creates compact context summaries

### 4. Integration with Sketch

**Modified:**
- `loop/agent.go` - Integrated cortex routing before LLM calls
- Added `cortex *cortex.Cortex` field to Agent struct
- Implemented `ChooseExpert()` flow that prepends expert system prompts

**Key Design Decision:**
For v1, we chose a **lightweight integration** approach:
- Cortex evaluates and selects expert
- Expert's system prompt is prepended to conversation
- Existing `convo.SendMessage()` handles actual execution
- Maintains all Sketch state management (tools, history, usage tracking)

This avoids complex refactoring while enabling full expert system functionality.

### 5. Performance Tracking

**Logging System:**
- JSON-based performance logs
- Tracks: expert used, tokens, duration, success/failure, escalations
- Daily log files: `cortex/logs/performance_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Statistics API for analysis

### 6. Self-Awareness Prompts

Each expert has carefully crafted system prompts that:
- Define their strengths and weaknesses explicitly
- Guide confidence self-assessment
- Provide clear escalation criteria
- Use structured JSON responses for decisions

**Example (FirstAttendant):**
```
CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
HIGH (0.8-1.0) - Handle yourself:
  - Simple file operations
  - Pattern matching
  - Clear git commands

MEDIUM (0.5-0.79) - Escalate to SecondThought:
  - Tasks requiring 3+ steps
  - Ambiguous requirements

LOW (<0.5) - Escalate immediately:
  - Complex architectural decisions
  - Security-critical changes
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Cortex initialization
- ✅ Expert selection logic
- ✅ Complexity assessment heuristics
- ✅ Performance logging
- ✅ All tests pass

```bash
$ go test ./cortex -v
=== RUN   TestCortexInitialization
--- PASS: TestCortexInitialization (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestExpertSelection
--- PASS: TestExpertSelection (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestComplexityAssessment
--- PASS: TestComplexityAssessment (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestPerformanceLogging
--- PASS: TestPerformanceLogging (0.00s)
PASS
```

## Key Features

### Cost Optimization
- Automatically uses cheaper models when appropriate
- Potential 60-70% cost reduction on routine tasks
- Premium models reserved for truly complex work

### Complexity Assessment
Heuristic-based scoring (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Keywords (architecture, refactor, security, etc.)
- Multi-file operations
- Content length
- Task structure

### Escalation Flow
```
User Request
     ↓
FirstAttendant (gpt-5-nano)
     ↓ (if low confidence)
SecondThought (DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp)
     ↓ (if elite complexity)
Elite (claude-sonnet-4-5)
     ↓
Response
```

### Configurable & Extensible
- YAML-based profiles (no code changes needed)
- Hot-reloadable expert definitions
- Easy to add specialized experts
- Environment-specific configurations

## What's Next (Future Work)

### 1. Meta-Expert Integration
- Activate PerformanceAnalyzer for automatic optimization suggestions
- Implement ExpertRecruiter for identifying specialist needs
- Deploy MemorySummarizer for context management

### 2. Machine Learning Enhancement
- Replace heuristic complexity scoring with ML model
- Train on performance logs
- Dynamic threshold adjustment

### 3. Parallel Execution (Mentioned as Phase 2)
- For now: sequential to avoid conflicts
- Future: parallel tool execution with conflict resolution

### 4. Specialized Experts
Based on usage patterns, create domain-specific experts:
- DatabaseExpert (SQL, migrations)
- TestingExpert (unit tests, coverage)
- APIExpert (REST, GraphQL)
- FrontendExpert (React, Vue)
- DevOpsExpert (Docker, CI/CD)

### 5. Memory System
- Expert-specific persistent memory
- Session summarization
- Escalation context compression

## Technical Decisions

### Why YAML for Profiles?
- Human-readable and editable
- No compilation needed for changes
- Easy to version control
- Simple to validate

### Why Heuristic Complexity Scoring (v1)?
- Fast and deterministic
- No training data required
- Transparent decision-making
- Good starting point for ML later

### Why Lightweight Integration?
- Minimal disruption to existing Sketch architecture
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Easy to disable if needed
- Can be enhanced incrementally

## Compliance & Attribution

✅ **Apache License 2.0 Requirements Met:**
- Clear attribution to Bold Software in README
- Original LICENSE file preserved
- Project renamed to avoid confusion
- All modifications documented

## Performance Expectations

Based on typical task distribution:

| Task Type | Frequency | Expert | Cost Factor |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Simple    | 60%       | gpt-5-nano | 0.1x |
| Medium    | 30%       | DeepSeek | 0.3x |
| Complex   | 10%       | Claude | 1.0x |

**Expected average cost:** ~0.25x of using Claude for everything

**Cost reduction:** ~75% while maintaining quality on complex tasks
