Going from a passing test to a test with build errors is a regression

-- p_test.go --
package p

import "testing"

func TestP(t *testing.T) {
}

-- .commit --
Initial commit with passing test

-- p_test.go --
package p

import "testing"

func TestP(t *testing.T) {
	(
}

-- .commit --
Break test with build error

-- .run_test --
# Errors

Test regressions detected between initial commit (INITIAL_COMMIT_HASH) and HEAD:

1: sketch.dev: Was passing, now has build/vet errors


Please fix before proceeding.
