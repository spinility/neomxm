# NeoMXM Integration Summary

## What Was Done

This document explains the integration of Sketch source code into the NeoMXM project as its development interface.

### 1. Project Context

**NeoMXM Development Interface** is not a standalone project - it's a **component of NeoMXM**:
- Originally based on source code from [Sketch by Bold Software](https://github.com/boldsoftware/sketch)
- Now completely independent with full NeoMXM ownership
- No compatibility or connection to original Sketch
- Adapted to serve as NeoMXM's development interface
- Integrated with NeoMXM's Cortex expert system
- Full control over codebase for NeoMXM workflow optimization

### 2. Configuration System

Created a complete `.env`-based configuration system:

#### Files Created:
- `.env.example` - Template with all configuration options
- `cortex/config.go` - Configuration loader (environment variables)
- `cortex/model_router.go` - Intelligent model routing to correct APIs
- `CONFIGURATION.md` - Comprehensive configuration guide

#### Key Features:
- **API Key Management**: Support for Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek
- **Model Selection**: Override models per expert via environment variables
- **Cost Controls**: Tracking, alerts, thresholds
- **Provider Detection**: Auto-route to correct API based on model name

#### Environment Variables:

```bash
# API Keys (at least one required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key

# Model Overrides (optional)
CORTEX_MODEL_FIRSTATTENDANT=gpt-4o-mini
CORTEX_MODEL_SECONDTHOUGHT=claude-sonnet-4.5
CORTEX_MODEL_ELITE=claude-opus-4

# System Settings
CORTEX_ENABLED=true
CORTEX_TRACK_COSTS=true
CORTEX_DEBUG=false
```

### 3. Model Routing Architecture

#### Provider Auto-Detection

The system automatically routes to the correct API based on model name:

| Model Pattern | Provider | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| `claude-*`, `*-sonnet`, `*-opus` | Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4.5` |
| `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*` | OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `deepseek-*` | DeepSeek | `deepseek-reasoner` |

#### Request Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
Development Interface (sketch binary)
    ↓
Cortex Expert System
    ↓
Expert Selection (FirstAttendant → SecondThought → Elite)
    ↓
ModelRouter.Do()
    ↓
Detect Provider → Create Service → Execute
    ↓
API Call (Anthropic/OpenAI/DeepSeek)
```

### 4. Expert System Integration

Modified cortex to use ModelRouter instead of fixed LLM service:

**Before:**
```go
// Direct call to configured LLM service
resp, err := llmService.Do(ctx, request)
```

**After:**
```go
// Route through ModelRouter based on expert's configured model
resp, err := modelRouter.Do(ctx, expert.Profile.Model, request)
```

Each expert can now use a different model/provider:
- FirstAttendant → OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (fast, cheap)
- SecondThought → Anthropic claude-sonnet-4.5 (balanced)
- Elite → Anthropic claude-opus-4 (premium)

### 5. Testing

All tests pass with mock API keys:

```bash
cd /app && go test ./cortex -v
```

Tests cover:
- ✅ Configuration loading from environment
- ✅ Expert name normalization
- ✅ Model router provider detection
- ✅ Service caching
- ✅ Cortex initialization with config
- ✅ Expert selection logic

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **README.md** - Updated to explain NeoMXM integration
2. **CONFIGURATION.md** - Complete configuration guide
3. **cortex/README.md** - Updated to note NeoMXM context
4. **.env.example** - Documented template for all settings

### 7. Attribution & Independence

Proper attribution maintained while establishing independence:
- README clearly states this was originally based on Sketch by Bold Software
- Apache 2.0 license preserved (as required)
- **Complete independence declared** - no compatibility with original
- NeoMXM has full ownership and control
- No upstream synchronization or compatibility concerns

## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Copy configuration template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add at least one API key:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
   ```

3. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   make
   ./sketch
   ```

### Customizing Model Selection

Override any expert's model:

```bash
# Use OpenAI for everything (if you only have OpenAI key)
CORTEX_MODEL_FIRSTATTENDANT=gpt-4o-mini
CORTEX_MODEL_SECONDTHOUGHT=gpt-4o
CORTEX_MODEL_ELITE=o1-preview

# Or mix providers for optimal cost/quality
CORTEX_MODEL_FIRSTATTENDANT=gpt-4o-mini    # OpenAI (cheap)
CORTEX_MODEL_SECONDTHOUGHT=claude-sonnet-4.5 # Anthropic (quality)
CORTEX_MODEL_ELITE=deepseek-reasoner       # DeepSeek (reasoning)
```

### Monitoring

Performance logs saved to `cortex/logs/`:

```bash
# View recent performance
cat cortex/logs/performance_*.json | jq '.[-10:]'

# Calculate costs
cat cortex/logs/performance_*.json | jq 'map(.cost_usd) | add'
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Flexibility
- Easy to add new AI providers (just extend ModelRouter)
- Can use local models via custom endpoints
- Mix and match models per expert

### 2. Cost Optimization
- Route simple tasks to cheap models
- Use expensive models only when needed
- Track and alert on costs

### 3. Future-Proof
- New models added via config (no code changes)
- Expert profiles in YAML (easy to customize)
- Provider auto-detection handles new model naming

### 4. Full Control
- NeoMXM owns this codebase completely
- Can modify workflow as needed
- No dependency on external project for core functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real API keys** - Currently using mock keys in tests
2. **Monitor performance** - Review logs to optimize model selection
3. **Tune thresholds** - Adjust confidence/complexity thresholds based on results
4. **Add custom experts** - Create domain-specific expert profiles as needed
5. **Cost analysis** - Track actual savings vs. single-model approach

## Notes for Future Development

- The binary is named `sketch` (historical artifact from original codebase)
- **This is NeoMXM** - not Sketch, no compatibility maintained
- Free to modify anything without compatibility concerns
- Configuration is environment-based (`.env` file)
- All AI requests route through Cortex when `CORTEX_ENABLED=true`
- Provider detection is automatic based on model names
- Expert profiles can be customized in `cortex/profiles/`
- No need to track upstream Sketch changes - we own this code
